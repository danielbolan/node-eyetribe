=============

Webkit interface for TheEyeTribe eye tracker.

###What this does
  * Provide a way to combine eye tracking information with the DOM, with all the functionality of theEyeTribe tracker.
  * Demo as it stands simply moves three elements around the screen: the two smaller dots follow individual eyes, while the big marker denotes the smoothed average gaze coordinates.

###What this doesn't do
  * Calibrate. Right now that has to be done with their tools on the same monitor as the one you want to use.
  * Make a whole lot of sense. This was done to learn the API and see how difficult it would be to get running, so not a whole lot of effort was put into design/documentation. I'm sorry. :grimacing: If/when I start a project that needs it, I'll fix it up.
